                About me I was born in Carlton, Victoria, which makes me Australian. However, my cultural background and heritage lies in Greece where my grandparents were born and immigrated to Australia during the early 1960’s to escape from lack of jobs and poverty. Both my parents were born in Australia, the first-generation children of Greek immigrants but influenced by the Greek Orthodox religion and a retained culture that has followed Greeks wherever they move to many centuries. I do in fact speak Greek and understand the language, but I am not as fluent as my parents are, as they grew up with the Greek language with their parents more than I have. I have completed my highest education which was Year 12 at Emmanuel College VCE in 2021 with my subjects being English, Further Maths, Psychology, Software Development (Applied Computing), VET Sport and Recreation and a bit of CISCO networking in Year 10. </p>

              <p>I am the only child of my family, born in Victoria, Australia. My mum’s side is German, while my dad’s side of the family are Serbian. I love playing video games, fawning over retro technology, and listening to my music in my spare time. I love to help solve IT issues, whether it is for my friends or family. I am quite patient with finding solutions on the Internet as well as using my prior knowledge, which I am renowned for among people who know me well. I am extremely interested in the cybersecurity, networking, and IT administration fields, and hope to specialise in either of said fields in the future. </p>

          <h1>Quan - Full Stack Developer</h1>
          <img src="" alt="">
          <p>A Full Stack Developer is responsible for all aspects of software from the front end to the backend. I really like this position since I can control every process of development, and I can shape the software into the product that I have envisioned. The skills required for this job is varied since there are many coding languages out there, and you can't master all of them in this short amount of time. However, mastering some very popular languages like JavaScript, Java, Python, or C++ is the best option since you can create various applications from those languages. Mastering the skills to manage a database is also very important in this job since most applications these days are so heavily data driven. In this position, it is best to know how to deploy a server on Linux. It is also important to know how to troubleshoot if a server fails. These are the skills that many companies are looking for. Currently, I am quite fluent in JavaScript and Python and have had some experience working with some database software like MongoDB and SQL. In the future, I am planning to go deeper into the world of database software and server to further improve the skills that can help me achieve my dream job. I have set out a plan that in the first 6 months of this year, I would start learning the basic of database like how to structure it in an efficient way and best fit for the application. After the first 6 month, I would spend around a year to master the popular MongoDB software. In my last year, I would try to master the industry standard of SQL.
