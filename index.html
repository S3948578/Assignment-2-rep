          <h2>Our Project Details</h2>
          <div class="info">
              <h3>Introduction</h3>
              <p></p>
              <p>Our project idea involves teaching user's internet safety/cybersecurity in the form of several interactive games. This project aims to get users to learn and be educated about cybersecurity in a more engaging way, rather than just printed words on a page. This considers the different learning styles users may have. This also aims to get users to retain and recognise unsafe internet behaviour and common methods that can cause individuals to lose their accounts or get their personal information stolen. </p>
              <p>With how common it is for users to be naïve and fall for malicious tactics that are used to steal data, there is a dire need to educate internet users of all ages to be alert and be cautious about their actions. This can span from where their personal data is entered, to what and where users are downloading files on the internet, recognising ways to identify scams, etc. With billions of people using the internet in various ways every single day, an innovative way to teach cybersecurity is crucial to have, no matter how tech savvy particular users are. There should be something for everyone provided in this project, from simple, easy to understand tasks for novice internet users, to more challenging activities for more advanced individuals. The newer generation may be more aware of internet safety, but older generations such as the elderly and even older adult populations that are not used to modern technology may need more guidance.</p>

              <h3>Description</h3>
              <p>This project will be presented in either a mobile application or webpage format. There will be 3 games included that would be suitable for a daily or endless challenge model. The games will also be suitable for all skill levels, whether the user is a novice or advanced with their knowledge surrounding internet security / cybersecurity. These games will also focus on different aspects that the topic covers. For each game, there will be a matching cartoon that serves as a help guide for the user. It will teach the user how to play each game and the rules in a visual format. There will also be a general description explaining to the user what cybersecurity is if the user is completely new to the topic.</p>
              <p>The first game will be a guessing game that will focus on teaching users how to not fall for malware or common scam tactics. The ‘decrypted’ information will either be an important keyword, sentence or even a paragraph depending on how difficult the user decides to make the puzzle. </p>
              <p>The user will have a set number of mistakes they are allowed to make, from 10 mistakes maximum to no mistakes at all (sudden death). For each letter in the ‘encrypted’ string, the user will attempt to guess what letter it should be when it is decrypted. For example, the letter ‘C’ in the encrypted string may correspond to the letter ‘A’ when decrypted. If the letter is in the string, but the user guessed it in the incorrect spot, the user will be notified that the letter is in a different position. If it is not there at all, the user will be told that the letter is not present in the decrypted string. If the user wants to put more pressure on themselves for a challenge, the user can choose to set a time limit. If the user makes more than the allowed number of mistakes or they run out of time, they lose.</p>
              <p>The second game will take on a more traditional quiz format, where the user is presented with multiple answers to a question and must pick the correct one. The questions will relate to various cybersecurity and internet security topics. The user will have 15 seconds to pick out of 5 possible answers. There will also be a hint system, that can be used once per question to help the user discern what answer might be the more correct one if they are stuck. The user will start with 5 hints. The user also has 3 “lives”, that serves as the number of incorrect guesses they can make. If the user picks an incorrect answer, they will not be allowed to guess for that same question again and they will lose a life. If the user loses all 3 lives, the game will end. There will be bonus question milestones at every 10th question that if it is answered correctly, the user can choose if they want to regain a life or regain a hint. </p>
              <p>Examples of question formats that may be asked include:</p>
              <p>Description style questions where the user will identify what the description is relating to. For example: a description of a type of malware or software. </p>
              <p>Which is not (blank) style questions where the user identifies what is not correct, such as “Which is not something you should do to stay safe on the Internet?” or “Which is not a type of physical security?” </p>
              <p>What is a feature of (blank) style questions such as “What is a feature of a firewall?” or “What is a feature of a modem?” </p>
              <p>General e-safety questions such as “What is one thing you should do to stay safe while posting on social media?” </p>
              <p>The last game will focus on teaching users how to identify suspicious links and executables. This will be a game that allows the user to take their time answering the questions so they can build up their identification skills. The user should learn from this game that they are the first line of defence when protecting their device from malicious software. Easier types of questions will involve scenarios that are more descriptive and straightforward. The scenarios should allow the user to easily find out whether it would be safe to access. There will be little clues that will help, such as a video having negative comments, a clickbait title, etc. Harder scenarios will give less hints towards if it is safe or not and may include links that may be misspelt. The user can choose to take their time to learn by not having a time limit, or the user can enable a 20 second time limit to test their knowledge or to challenge themself.</p>
              <h3>Tools and Software</h3>
              <p>In terms of software and tools needed to build a working prototype of the project idea, this will depend on if we decide to make the final product a mobile application or website. Prototyping websites include Figma, Canva and Proto.io. If we decide to go with the website route, we will need to consider expanding our current HTML and CSS knowledge beyond what we know already. This will require us to learn more advanced HTML and CSS techniques online. We will most likely have to incorporate other programming languages in order to develop the 3 games (e.g., Python, C++, C#, Java etc.) We will also have to consider the different browsers that are being used, and ensure the HTML works as intended as closely as possible between the popular browser choices. A mock-up of how the website should look and function may be beneficial as well.</p>
              <p> For the mobile application route, we will need to consider different mobile operating systems such as Android and iOS. If we were to develop a complete application, we would have to learn how to use the iOS SDK and Android Studio for both mobile operating systems. No matter what route we choose to produce our prototype/ final product, we will need to futureproof our product to ensure compatibility with new software updates. We may choose to make the final product a website due to our prior experiences. </p>

              <h3>Outcome</h3>
              <p>If this project is successful, the user reception should be positive, with the website or application being engaging and enjoyable. Their knowledge of internet safety and cybersecurity should increase to the point where they are more conscious of their actions while browsing the Internet and are able to identify if something may be harmful. This should solve the original lack of attention and awareness issue. This should revolutionise how individuals learn about cybersecurity, while still being as effective as a reading approach. </p>

              <p>
                I was born in Carlton, Victoria, which makes me Australian. However, my cultural background and heritage lies in Greece where my grandparents were born and immigrated to Australia during the early 1960’s to escape from lack of jobs and poverty. Both my parents were born in Australia, the first-generation children of Greek immigrants but influenced by the Greek Orthodox religion and a retained culture that has followed Greeks wherever they move to many centuries. I do in fact speak Greek and understand the language, but I am not as fluent as my parents are, as they grew up with the Greek language with their parents more than I have. I have completed my highest education which was Year 12 at Emmanuel College VCE in 2021 with my subjects being English, Further Math, Psychology, Software Development (Applied Computing), VET Sport and Recreation and a bit of CISCO networking in Year 10. </p>

          <img src="" alt="">
          <p>A Full Stack Developer is responsible for all aspects of software from the front end to the backend. I really like this position since I can control every process of development, and I can shape the software into the product that I have envisioned. The skills required for this job is varied since there are many coding languages out there, and you can't master all of them in this short amount of time. However, mastering some very popular languages like JavaScript, Java, Python, or C++ is the best option since you can create various applications from those languages. Mastering the skills to manage a database is also very important in this job since most applications these days are so heavily data driven. In this position, it is best to know how to deploy a server on Linux. It is also important to know how to troubleshoot if a server fails. These are the skills that many companies are looking for. Currently, I am quite fluent in JavaScript and Python and have had some experience working with some database software like MongoDB and SQL. In the future, I am planning to go deeper into the world of database software and server to further improve the skills that can help me achieve my dream job. I have set out a plan that in the first 6 months of this year, I would start learning the basic of database like how to structure it in an efficient way and best fit for the application. After the first 6 month, I would spend around a year to master the popular MongoDB software. In my last year, I would try to master the industry standard of SQL.

  <h3> Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not? </h3>
  <p>Romy: Now that I have looked at the Burning Glass data, my opinion about being a cybersecurity analyst has changed slightly. I can see that this job does have less collaboration and teamwork skills involved, however I would still have to communicate to higher-ups about my progress and what risks I found whist analysing their current security setup. There is not a lot of writing work involved: being a cybersecurity analyst requires more problem solving and planning skills in order to create a detailed protection plan, which I like. I may wish to seek another job if I wanted more of the teamwork aspect, but this job also provides the troubleshooting and quality assessment aspects that I would like to see in my future IT job.</p>
  <p>Quan: When I have finished looking at the Burning Glass data, my opinion about being a full stack software developer changed quite a bit in one aspect which is communication skills. From looking at the selections, I can see that collaboration and team management are one of the highest skills in demand from me. Writing also stands out for me since I didn’t know that there was this many requirements for writing skills. Writing skills is quite important in my job since we need to document every change that we make through the entire plan in order to be as transparent as possible for our customers</p>
  <p>Gauri – After thoroughly researching my job at the Burning Glass Data, my opinion in relation to my ideal job change much because the IT and generic Skills that would support me to get the job were not properly listed in the job advertisement. One of the most important lessons that I learned during my research is that no matter the skills listed in the job, some additional skills and knowledge is always required. Skills such as Communication knowledge, leadership, maintaining healthy relationships were already in the job description. In addition to this, I realised I need to be an active participant in all the projects, make sure that they are up to date. This would require me to have planning, decision-making, meeting deadlines and research skills.</p>
  <p>Alex: After looking through the burning class data. My Ideal Job has changed from joining the Army as a Cyber Specialist for learning technology and techniques to target cyber threats and defend Army networks was practical. However, there is a way more technical skills involved than just army networks. With my new Ideal Job being Security Testing Specialist at Telstra, this required way my prerequisite skills and had more general based skills than what I originally thought of which are Time-Management skills, Planning, Troubleshooting, and Management. Also, employers want these key responsibilities to be adhered to which are Conducting assessments of threats and vulnerabilities, developing security testing reports and finding out areas in which a security system can be improved.</p>

          <h3>Raspberry pi, Arduino and Nvidia Jetson</h3>
          <p></p>
          <p>Raspberry Pi, Arduino and Nvidia Jetson are all small form factor single board computers developed and manufactured by the Raspberry Pi foundation, Smart Projects and Nvidia respectively. These single board computers are very popular among developer for prototyping and enthusiast for use in their personal project because of its’ cheap cost and open-source nature. Despite all being single board computers the size of your hand, they could have not been more different in their target audience and what they are mainly being used for. At the very basic level is the Arduino, an open-source hardware and software project aims to be a cheap solution to teach the basic of robotics and programming to children by making it fun and simple.</p>
          <p>Raspberry Pi was initially designed to be a cheap and easy solution for schools to teach students on computer science. At the very basic level, a raspberry pi can be used as a normal functional Linux computer, it can perform daily task like edit a word document, browsing the internet, watching video and light video gaming with the included Minecraft Pi Edition. But you can do so much more with the Raspberry Pi, one of the most popular ways is to transform it into a fully functional gaming console that could play most of the retro game from the ATARI 2600 to the PSP.</p>
          <p>This is made possible by a software called Retropie that gathers all the popular emulator software and puts it in a very neat console user interface. Raspberry Pi foundation also makes accessories that can be attached onto the computer using their priority connector that expands the possible usage. Using the 7-inch touch screen accessory, some users have been able to create their own smart home controller just like a google nest hub that can tell them time, weather, calendar and even controls the lights, air-conditioning, and garage door with an addition of a relay module that communicate to the board using the 40 pins header. But there is quite a bit of limitation with the current raspberry pi due to the limit of their processing power, so the Raspberry Pi struggles in other more heavier tasks like advanced AI and image recognition.</p>
          <p>This is where the much more powerful Nvidia Jetson X2 comes in. The Nvidia Jetson targets at the software developer market rather than the education market like the 2 other board, it aims to provide a dedicated board that is optimize for the development of Artificial Intelligence and advanced image recognition. Some application that has utilised the Jetson power includes powering an autonomous vehicle using a camera to recognise and process the information on the road. The future is very bright for these board, as technology progresses these board will get faster and faster and can do more complicated tasks.</p>
          <p>Nvidia has set out a plan for the Jetson platform for the next 7 years, the company expected by the year 2026 Jetson can be able to be powered autonomous vehicle and help contribute to further the advancement of autonomous vehicles. These single board computers will also have a very bright future on the Internet of things or IOT sector since they can be able to help developer prototype and develop more and more polished software that can smoothly communicate with the hardware.</p>

          <p>The creation of single board computers has more impact on people daily life than you think. The single board computers will create more jobs for the education sector since more and more schools are having new computing classes since they realise how much valuable it is to have a solid grasp of the current technology in the current landscape. This also means that demand for these board will be very high which means more jobs for the manufacturing business and fuel the global supply chain even more. More content creation job will also be created due to the high demand for quality online video content to teach and showcase students what the possibilities of these board can do.</p>
          <p> Both hardware and software developer jobs will also be created more to cater for the growing community and demand for the board. One of the jobs that will make obsolete by this progress in technology are manual books that teaches you how to code since now the student can get a more up to date and more hands-on experience with the computer instead of just learning the theories. The group that will be benefited the most from this progress in the single board computer market are the primary and secondary school students since they now can have access to the same technology that engineers, and developers uses, and it can help fuel their passion for the technology industry. This passion can turn into career choices and the student will be better than the current engineer and software developers since they have an earlier start with more hands-on experience. The cheap cost of the hardware can also help with third world country to have access more to modern day technology.</p>

          <p>These changes to the single board computer market will have an immense impact on my daily life and my friend and family as well, the creation of these board has initiated so many different ideas that eventually came into fruition and become Silicon Valley level start up. This technology has also been amazing for my dad who is in the agricultural industry.</p>
          <p>Last year, me and my uncle created an automatic watering system that sends out the appropriate amount of water based on how much rain it was that day. We saved tens of thousands of dollars by using a raspberry pi and an Arduino to power the system and it only takes 3 days to build. Imagine a world without them, it would cost more and consume more time to create a similar system. I also use Nvidia Jetson X1 to create a powerful Minecraft server for me and my friends to play on with incredible reliability for less than half of the cost of a full-blown pc. My uncle also uses a raspberry pi to power his home automation system that can be easily controlled using voice commands through the Google Home system.</p>

          <h3>Clouds/services/servers</h3>
          <p></p>
          <p>Clouds and servers are services provided in cloud computing. Cloud computing provides these services over the Internet, to "...offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale." (Microsoft Azure) Cloud computing allows for an organisation or individual to select the services they need, lowering operating costs, easier management of infrastructure and better adaptability when current needs change. Clouds and servers have revolutionised how users access particular services, without them even realising cloud computing is the core to making them work behind the scenes.
          <p>There are various online services that currently use cloud services. Storing, backing up and recovery of data is now possible using a cloud storage system, and is accessible from any location and any device, provided there is Internet access. Audio and video streaming services such as Spotify, YouTube, Netflix etc., use servers to provide global distribution of their content anywhere and at any time. Software upgrades/updates are also provided by cloud computing to allow users to get their software up to date.</p>
          <p>Clouds, servers, and other cloud computing services already contribute a great amount to how we manage resources and perform various tasks, however cloud computing has and will further develop to be involved in other aspects. Due to the pandemic that began late 2019, there was a need for organisations and individuals to conduct work safely without needing to be in a face-to-face environment. This is where cloud computing was able to make an impact. The use of clouds was used prevalently to allow collaboration between files, communicate between groups via email and messaging as well as accessing content.</p>
          <p>Cloud computing allowed schools and workplaces to create an environment where individuals could conduct tasks as close to normal as possible, without the need to compromise safety. Meeting services such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams, found a new purpose by providing a platform where individuals or groups of people can meet and talk to each other. Of course, cloud computing also allowed for meetings to be hosted and stored on a server, with the information being relayed to the meeting members (usually with some form of end-to-end encryption as well). This created the hybrid working environment that is still used today in certain scenarios, mainly by workplaces and some learning environments.</p>
          <p>More companies are predicted to switch to cloud provided services, as cloud computing continues to evolve and be used in more situations. This means the safety of using clouds and services, especially those provided by a third-party, will have to be considered further as companies decide to use more of these technologies over traditional, local methods. With computer and server hardware evolving, mainly graphics processing units and computing processors (GPU and CPU's), more complex applications may be able to be performed using cloud computing. Emerging technology such as artificial intelligence (AI), is becoming increasingly popular. In the case of AI, clouds and servers may benefit from intelligence that learns over time and with use, such as machine or deep learning.</p>
          <p>This can allow for optimisation of resource management and automation of cloud/server maintenance, organisation and more. AI related services have already been provided to cloud services, such as Microsoft Azure Machine Learning, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Machine Learning Engine and more. Open-source software and services are also possible to be implemented in the near future and can allow organisations or groups to satisfy their own requirements or use the services they wish to use, in the case of open-source vs closed source software.</p>
          <p>Open-source software allows for modification due to the source code being readily available and can be hosted on platforms such as GitHub. The concept of serverless computing is being investigated as well and has the possibility to make cloud computing more reliable, reduce the amount of backend code that needs to be written, and reduce the amount of administration needed to manage the cloud service. Essentially, instead of resources being managed by servers, they could be managed by the cloud provider in the future. The Internet of Things (IoT) framework and the Internet as a whole, are both essential to the existence of cloud computing. Without devices that can connect to the Internet, and a computer network, clouds, servers, and cloud related services would not exist, simply due to the fact there would be no online services to make use of the technology.</p>

          <p>Cloud computing has already changed the way people store and modify files, by providing an online method separate from network attached storage or local storage. This allows for an alternative way to manage data, given that the local network or device is unable to be accessed or has been damaged due to an event, whether it is a natural disaster, unauthorised access or malware intrusion. TV programs are likely to become less popular with new generations, as video streaming services gain more traction among younger audiences. Purchasing vinyl's and CD's will most likely become obsolete as music streaming continues to gain popularity.</p>
          <p>Buying music singles, albums and movies online may still be a concept in the future, but if subscription services continue to be popular among the masses, purchasing music may become a rarity. This will affect the way artists will gain royalties from their works. News reporters and TV celebrities will most likely not benefit from viewership from those still using a television in the future. More jobs will be created to maintain online cloud storage systems and to develop services that rely on cloud computing, as the demand for workers in the cloud computing field increases. Likewise, jobs for people responsible for maintaining LAN storage systems may decrease if an organisation decides to rely more on the cloud to store and access data.</p>

          <p>Cloud computing personally contributes to a great amount of my daily life. Cloud storage services, such as Google Drive, have been my way to allow myself to upload, access and edit documents from any device and wherever I am. Google Drive and the office suite Google provides has allowed me to do work and have a backup of my important documents in case I cannot access my computer. My family also uses cloud storage to back up their photos and videos across the years and helps them with saving storage on their devices locally. Since music and video streaming has become more popular, my friends and I see ourselves listening to music on streaming services like Spotify rather than using physical CD media. The same can be said with video streaming, we prefer to watch content on YouTube and other online video subscription services rather than watching TV like we did in the past.</p>
          <p>Not only can we watch the content we are interested in at any time, but we can also access shows that were previously on TV and watch them at our own pace. The way my friends, family and I communicate to others have also changed due to the involvement of servers, allowing for us to communicate online with any device as well. This spans from instant messaging services, to email and social media. While I prefer to communicate to my friends through instant messaging services, my parents like to use social media such as Facebook and TikTok to chat to their friends and for their own enjoyment. My friends and I are also able to play the latest versions of our games, thanks to updates being on-demand and readily available to download on servers. Cloud computing has also allowed for my friends and I who are attending university to join virtual classrooms in a hybrid setting, thanks to services that provide meeting rooms for students and teachers to teach and learn in.</p>

          <h3>Robotics</h3>
          <p></p>
          <p>Robots began as small simple machines, and then has been increasing the size and robustness technology. They do simple tasks programmed by a human. These robots would simply provide better efficiency with less human work to complete certain tasks. Robotics is also used for protecting workers from most some of the most dangerous, mundane, repetitive tasks whilst creating more desirable jobs such as engineering, programming management and equipment maintenance industries. Robots have the potential to be as flexible as possible having automated tools that have greatly improved as the capacity of microprocessors and artificial intelligence techniques has rapidly increased. The new surge of robotics is in applications of artificial intelligence. Robotic technology is converging with a wide variety of complementary technologies – machine vision, force sensing (touch), speech recognition and advanced mechanics.</p>
          <p>This results in exciting new levels of functionality for jobs that were never considered practical for robots. For example, for many years robotics has been used to be efficient and effective for car manufacturing services are produced by robots given a schematic by humans. Their tasks are to assemble the parts for the frame of a car and weld it together. This gives high value of the finished product with robot’s productivity being automated is an enormous industry and continuously growing. The current state of robotics is to build a more job safer future whilst also keeping efficiency as a crucial factor.</p>
          <p>We cannot disregard drones as they can also be robots themselves. Either they are controlled by an operator and/or given an AI program to determine the best possible decision for travel and for maintenance such as agriculture to increase productivity for farms by check the progress of plants that are growing and as the demand for food is increasing rapidly for consumers. Also, drone is capable for future years to carry somewhat heavy loads of deliveries that customers order from home. In today’s world, we have managed to program robots to be able to replicate human movement and interaction. Boston Dynamics have pushed this limit to its fullest with their humanoid robot called Atlas has given advanced technology made to give the robot power to demonstrate the balance and human-level agility.</p>
          <p>Atlas was intended to aid emergency services in search and rescue operations, performing tasks such as shutting off valves, opening doors and operating powered equipment in environments where humans could not survive. With Atlas being one of the best prototypes Boston Dynamics has ever created, parkour movement was implemented using advanced control system. This enables highly diverse and agile locomotion, while algorithms reason through complex dynamic interactions involving the whole body. With lightweight body of 89kg and 1.5m in height, high powered hydraulics is what enables Atlas to deliver high power with 28 hydraulics for the best manoeuvrability. Having 28 joints with a top speed of 2.5m/s. Not only is their development into a humanoid, but they have also made a sellable robot called spot. This revolutionises our way of creating more sustainable humanoids in our society using these new technologies. </p>

          <p>The likely impact of robots taking over our jobs is inevitable. Automation, effectiveness of mass-producing products such robots working on cars that is currently at manufactures will be the obvious job take over. Transporting heavy cargo loads using autonomous technology and even drone delivery service will be in the far future. These can replace the everyday Uber Eat Drivers, Uber Taxi Drivers with autonomous vehicles having AI built instructions and certain rules the robot must follow for safe travels such as a navigation map and smart sensors all around the car to detect white lines on the road to prevent the car from driving off the road. Robots are already being implemented and automated in Sorting agriculture products from farms and other sorts of packaged items. This will great more farmers to be more focused on the quality of the farm products and maintain any land defects or products that may not be useable.</p>
          <p>The list keeps going for jobs robots will be able to do such as Security surveillance drones/robots, customer service robots, precise surgery in hospitals to operate on humans which is starting to become a reality with the first surgical robot performing a surgery on a grape which is the one of the most hilarious yet amazing progress. This can massively affect against humans whose jobs are the core of keeping the world go round which can lead to poverty but reduce human life risks. However, even if robots will take up most of our jobs. This is where new jobs come into the picture as there will be also concurrent jobs that will not be taken over by robots that humans still need to keep the world running.</p>
          <p>Having more roles in Education and Schooling are really one of the most important as student work is high subjective which cannot be automated as efficiently. For instance, Having many different responses from students after a test or exam. Robots can only be automated in marking multiple-choice answer questions as they are easily quantitative with only having one right answer. Another Job that will open more is Programmers and System Analysts. For coming years, AI programming itself will become a part of robots that will perform certain routines but cannot be as perfected as customer service help desks and able to learn how to reply to a customer effectively so certain customer serving jobs will most likely rise.</p>

          <p>Robotics is and will be increasingly more common in part everyone’s daily life in the future years with more job changes and has a possibility of losing your favourite job. It would affect not just family and friends, more so globally with families having to do less in the household with everyday robots taking care of the daily house needs which will make us humans become lazier. I also believe robots will rule over our lack of precision in terms of us having to trial and error many times over whilst a robot can be easily perfected with our failures. Not onsly will robots be in fact be a part of daily life, but it will also be everywhere. There would be a sense of insecurity was you never know if robots having any listening devices hidden within the bodies of robots that may gain personal information against you.</p>
