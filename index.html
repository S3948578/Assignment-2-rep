          <h2>Our Project Details</h2>
          <div class="info">
              <h3>Introduction</h3>
              <p></p>
              <p>Our project idea involves teaching user's internet safety/cybersecurity in the form of several interactive games. This project aims to get users to learn and be educated about cybersecurity in a more engaging way, rather than just printed words on a page. This considers the different learning styles users may have. This also aims to get users to retain and recognise unsafe internet behaviour and common methods that can cause individuals to lose their accounts or get their personal information stolen. </p>
              <p>With how common it is for users to be naïve and fall for malicious tactics that are used to steal data, there is a dire need to educate internet users of all ages to be alert and be cautious about their actions. This can span from where their personal data is entered, to what and where users are downloading files on the internet, recognising ways to identify scams, etc. With billions of people using the internet in various ways every single day, an innovative way to teach cybersecurity is crucial to have, no matter how tech savvy particular users are. There should be something for everyone provided in this project, from simple, easy to understand tasks for novice internet users, to more challenging activities for more advanced individuals. The newer generation may be more aware of internet safety, but older generations such as the elderly and even older adult populations that are not used to modern technology may need more guidance.</p>

              <h3>Description</h3>
              <p>This project will be presented in either a mobile application or webpage format. There will be 3 games included that would be suitable for a daily or endless challenge model. The games will also be suitable for all skill levels, whether the user is a novice or advanced with their knowledge surrounding internet security / cybersecurity. These games will also focus on different aspects that the topic covers. For each game, there will be a matching cartoon that serves as a help guide for the user. It will teach the user how to play each game and the rules in a visual format. There will also be a general description explaining to the user what cybersecurity is if the user is completely new to the topic.</p>
              <p>The first game will be a guessing game that will focus on teaching users how to not fall for malware or common scam tactics. The ‘decrypted’ information will either be an important keyword, sentence or even a paragraph depending on how difficult the user decides to make the puzzle. </p>
              <p>The user will have a set number of mistakes they are allowed to make, from 10 mistakes maximum to no mistakes at all (sudden death). For each letter in the ‘encrypted’ string, the user will attempt to guess what letter it should be when it is decrypted. For example, the letter ‘C’ in the encrypted string may correspond to the letter ‘A’ when decrypted. If the letter is in the string, but the user guessed it in the incorrect spot, the user will be notified that the letter is in a different position. If it is not there at all, the user will be told that the letter is not present in the decrypted string. If the user wants to put more pressure on themselves for a challenge, the user can choose to set a time limit. If the user makes more than the allowed number of mistakes or they run out of time, they lose.</p>
              <p>The second game will take on a more traditional quiz format, where the user is presented with multiple answers to a question and must pick the correct one. The questions will relate to various cybersecurity and internet security topics. The user will have 15 seconds to pick out of 5 possible answers. There will also be a hint system, that can be used once per question to help the user discern what answer might be the more correct one if they are stuck. The user will start with 5 hints. The user also has 3 “lives”, that serves as the number of incorrect guesses they can make. If the user picks an incorrect answer, they will not be allowed to guess for that same question again and they will lose a life. If the user loses all 3 lives, the game will end. There will be bonus question milestones at every 10th question that if it is answered correctly, the user can choose if they want to regain a life or regain a hint. </p>
              <p>Examples of question formats that may be asked include:</p>
              <p>Description style questions where the user will identify what the description is relating to. For example: a description of a type of malware or software. </p>
              <p>Which is not (blank) style questions where the user identifies what is not correct, such as “Which is not something you should do to stay safe on the Internet?” or “Which is not a type of physical security?” </p>
              <p>What is a feature of (blank) style questions such as “What is a feature of a firewall?” or “What is a feature of a modem?” </p>
              <p>General e-safety questions such as “What is one thing you should do to stay safe while posting on social media?” </p>
              <p>The last game will focus on teaching users how to identify suspicious links and executables. This will be a game that allows the user to take their time answering the questions so they can build up their identification skills. The user should learn from this game that they are the first line of defence when protecting their device from malicious software. Easier types of questions will involve scenarios that are more descriptive and straightforward. The scenarios should allow the user to easily find out whether it would be safe to access. There will be little clues that will help, such as a video having negative comments, a clickbait title, etc. Harder scenarios will give less hints towards if it is safe or not and may include links that may be misspelt. The user can choose to take their time to learn by not having a time limit, or the user can enable a 20 second time limit to test their knowledge or to challenge themself.</p>
              <h3>Tools and Software</h3>
              <p>In terms of software and tools needed to build a working prototype of the project idea, this will depend on if we decide to make the final product a mobile application or website. Prototyping websites include Figma, Canva and Proto.io. If we decide to go with the website route, we will need to consider expanding our current HTML and CSS knowledge beyond what we know already. This will require us to learn more advanced HTML and CSS techniques online. We will also have to consider the different browsers that are being used, and ensure the HTML works as intended as closely as possible between the popular browser choices. A mock-up of how the website should look and function may be beneficial as well.</p>
              <p> For the mobile application route, we will need to consider different mobile operating systems such as Android and iOS. If we were to develop a complete application, we would have to learn how to use the iOS SDK and Android Studio for both mobile operating systems. No matter what route we choose to produce our prototype/ final product, we will need to futureproof our product to ensure compatibility with new software updates. </p>

              <h3>Outcome</h3>
              <p>If this project is successful, the user reception should be positive, with the website or application being engaging and enjoyable. Their knowledge of internet safety and cybersecurity should increase to the point where they are more conscious of their actions while browsing the Internet and are able to identify if something may be harmful. This should solve the original lack of attention and awareness issue. This should revolutionise how individuals learn about cybersecurity, while still being as effective as a reading approach. </p>

              <p>
                I was born in Carlton, Victoria, which makes me Australian. However, my cultural background and heritage lies in Greece where my grandparents were born and immigrated to Australia during the early 1960’s to escape from lack of jobs and poverty. Both my parents were born in Australia, the first-generation children of Greek immigrants but influenced by the Greek Orthodox religion and a retained culture that has followed Greeks wherever they move to many centuries. I do in fact speak Greek and understand the language, but I am not as fluent as my parents are, as they grew up with the Greek language with their parents more than I have. I have completed my highest education which was Year 12 at Emmanuel College VCE in 2021 with my subjects being English, Further Maths, Psychology, Software Development (Applied Computing), VET Sport and Recreation and a bit of CISCO networking in Year 10. </p>

My hobbies include karate, swimming, reading novels and painting. I am also interested in meeting new people and getting to know them. My interest in IT was generated when I came across my laptop and wondered how it was developed. I am also very much interested in testing all the prototypes of the new devices that the market and the IT world has to offer. The main reason I am interested in IT is because it pays well. I plan to major either in Cloud Foundations or Cybersecurity. </p>

          <img src="" alt="">
          <p>A Full Stack Developer is responsible for all aspects of software from the front end to the backend. I really like this position since I can control every process of development, and I can shape the software into the product that I have envisioned. The skills required for this job is varied since there are many coding languages out there, and you can't master all of them in this short amount of time. However, mastering some very popular languages like JavaScript, Java, Python, or C++ is the best option since you can create various applications from those languages. Mastering the skills to manage a database is also very important in this job since most applications these days are so heavily data driven. In this position, it is best to know how to deploy a server on Linux. It is also important to know how to troubleshoot if a server fails. These are the skills that many companies are looking for. Currently, I am quite fluent in JavaScript and Python and have had some experience working with some database software like MongoDB and SQL. In the future, I am planning to go deeper into the world of database software and server to further improve the skills that can help me achieve my dream job. I have set out a plan that in the first 6 months of this year, I would start learning the basic of database like how to structure it in an efficient way and best fit for the application. After the first 6 month, I would spend around a year to master the popular MongoDB software. In my last year, I would try to master the industry standard of SQL.
